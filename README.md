## 📄 Project Description

This system allows users to manage athletes and sports events dynamically. It provides a user-friendly interface via a command-line menu with 12 interactive options (0–11) for managing data such as athletes, events, and clubs.

Key functionalities include:
- Adding athletes and events
- Displaying and querying athlete-event relations
- Analyzing participation per event or club
- Sorting and deleting events
- Generating a combined club events report

## 📘 Topics Covered

This project demonstrates knowledge and practical application of the following C programming topics:

- 📁 **File Handling**
  - Reading from and writing to `.txt` files
  - Ensuring persistent storage of user data
- 📦 **Structs**
  - Defining and using structured data types for athletes and events
- 📍 **Pointers**
  - Managing dynamic memory and passing complex data to functions
- 🧠 **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
  - Using `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free` for flexible data management
- 🧮 **Strings and Arrays**
  - String manipulation with `strcpy`, `strcmp`, `strlen`, etc.
  - Managing arrays of structs dynamically
- 🔁 **Control Structures**
  - Mastery of `if`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, and `do-while`
- 🔎 **Input Validation**
  - Preventing invalid data entry through checks and filters
- 🧪 **Functions**
  - Decomposing logic into reusable helper functions
- 🔀 **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Sorting event data by year for clean output
- 📊 **User Interaction**
